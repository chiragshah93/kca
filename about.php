      <h2 class="style1">WORLD CLASS BRANDS</h2>
      <p>For over 60 years, Tupperware has been creating a niche for itself in   the business world, making a difference to the lives of millions   through its innovative storage products and extremely attractive   business opportunity. In recent years, Tupperware has made tremendous   inroads into becoming a true global entity. In 2000, Tupperware acquired   Dallas-based BeautiControl, followed by the acquisition of the Sara Lee   Corporation’s direct selling business in 2000. These advancements   brought an increasing product diversity to brand Tupperware. In order to   reflect this diversity, Tupperware Corporation changed its name to   Tupperware Brands Corporation in 2005.</p>
      <p>These acquisitions were in line with the Company’s corporate strategy   to add premium consumable items to their product category mix. They   also boosted the Company's global portfolio to eight champion brands and   changed the Tupperware Brands Corporation into a multi-brand,   multi-category, direct sales conglomerate with a worldwide sales force   of over 2 million.</p>
      <p>Despite the success and astounding growth of Tupperware Brands, the   Company’s mission and passion to enlighten, educate and empower   customers and their families tops the priority list.</p>
      <h2 class="style1">Enlighten</h2>
      <p>To share insights &amp; provide products and knowledge that makes life simpler and more enjoyable for families.</p>
      <h2 class="style1">Educate</h2>
      <p>To provide smart, simple solutions that enable customers to save time, money and effort while leading active and healthy lives.</p>
      <h2 class="style1">Empower</h2>
    <p>To better the lives of women by giving them the confidence to live with respect in the society and becoming independent.</p>      <p>To date, the Tupperware Brands portfolio of direct selling companies   incorporates Tupperware, BeautiControl, NaturCare, Nutrimetics, Fuller   Cosmetics, Nuvo, Avroy Shlain and Swissgarde - each with their own   product lines, sales methods and structures for the markets.</p></td>
